This is a new design for the Pixel 4 XL. The front and back parts are press fit but work better with a dab of CA to hold things together.


To print, split the STL into objects and place largest side down, here is an example

The top of the housing has captive buttons, buttons go largest side down and use CA to keep the two halves together, but this will press fit onto the top of the phone when sitting in the housing. Look at the instructions in the base repo as the Pixel 2 XL mount comes together the same way.
